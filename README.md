# Movie App - Additional Features

This project is part of a coding challenge that requires adding at least one feature to enhance the user experience. Below are the additional features implemented:

## 1. Movie Detail Page

### Description
A **Movie Detail Page** was added to provide users with detailed information about a selected movie, including its title, description, release date, rating, and poster. This improves the user experience by allowing users to explore more details about a movie.

### How to Use
- Click on a movie from the **search results** or **home page** or **category page** (Now Playing & Top Rated).
- The app will navigate to the **Movie Detail Page**, displaying detailed information about the selected movie.

### Implementation Details
- Fetched movie details from **TMDB API** using `React Query`.
- Displayed key movie information such as **title, overview, release date, rating, and poster**.
- Used **Next.js dynamic routing (`pages/movie/[id].tsx`)** to handle individual movie pages.

### Testing
- Manually tested to ensure data is correctly fetched and displayed.

## 2. Search Pagination

### Description
A simple **pagination feature** but usefull was added to the search results page, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of search results. This improves usability when searching for movies.

### How to Use
- When searching for a movie (min. 3 characters), results are displayed in **pages**.
- Users can click "Next" or "Previous" buttons to navigate between result pages, users can also go directly to a specific page number by changing the destination page number in the input provided.

### Implementation Details
- Utilized **TMDB APIâ€™s pagination feature** using the `page` query parameter.
- Added "Next" and "Previous" buttons to update the current page.
-	Added page number input that displays the current page, and can be changed to a specific destination page number.
- The current page is managed using **React state (`useState`)** and updated dynamically.

### Testing
- Manually tested to ensure pagination works correctly when navigating between pages.
